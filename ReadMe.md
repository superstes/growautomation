The goal is to automate activities related to the cultivation of plants.

And thus to minimize the associated repetitive tasks and optimize the process.

It's simple! And should remain so if you have little time for it.

## But what can it do?

### It provides:
* Simplified use of a <b>raspberry pi</b>
* A '<a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/workflow/input.html">input</a> => 
  <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/workflow/output.html#conditions">condition</a> => 
  <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/workflow/output.html#actions">output</a>' 
  <b>framework</b>
* Easy interaction through a <a href="https://demo.growautomation.eu"><b>web interface</b></a>
* Independence
  * The software-system has no need for external resources like cloud-services nor internet access
* A customizable <b>dashboard-system</b>


### It empowers you to:
* <b>Add</b> your <b>custom devices and actions</b>
* <b>Visually monitor</b> your sensor <b>data</b> via dashboards
* Use the web-ui to <b>easily troubleshoot</b> your hardware setup


### It can help you:
* Getting started with your own automation system
* Prevent <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/basic/troubleshoot.html">common mistakes</a> with your <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/device/input.html">hardware</a> and <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/setup/wiring.html">wiring</a>
* Optimizing your growing environment
* Having a great time growing

## Version
Version: 0.9

=> <a href="https://demo.growautomation.at/">DEMO</a> at its current state _(bugs included.. (; )_

### Work in progress
- testing and fixing output-reversal
- cleaning up the webUI


### History

- v0.9 _(2021-09 - 2021-10)_
  - action-buttons in webUI => allowing to manually start/stop sensors and actors
  - saving of action states to db => keeping track of active actors
  - added basic dark-mode


- v0.8 _(2021-03 - 2021-04)_
  - updated condition workflow
  - created basic <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu">documentation</a>
  - scripting setup using ansible


- v0.7 _(2020-12 - 2021-03)_
  - created basic _(django)_ web interface => <a href="https://demo.growautomation.at/">DEMO</a>
    - functionality:
      - config management
      - system management _(systemd / logs)_
      - help users test and debug their setup
      - customizable statistics/graphs
  - updated core to use django mysql schema


- v0.6 _(2020-11 - 2020-12)_
  - object-oriented config management
  

- v0.3 - v0.5 _(2020-02 - 2020-10)_
  - optimized code via implementing classes
  - created a systemd service to run the core
  

- v0.1 - v0.2 _(2019-05 - 2020-01)_
  - creating basic code structure _(functional programming)_


- v0.0 _(2018-ï¿½ - 2019-04)_
  - dark age _(connected scripts)_

### Planned features
- core functionalities
  - builtin tasks
    - notification => *get notified if the temperature is not optimal for growing*
    - backup => *timed backup of database and logs locally or on a remote target*
    - custom => *let the core execute custom timed tasks* (_cron-like_)
  - simple input-device rest-api => every network-attached device can be an input
  - providing offline documentation (_pre-build sphinx docs_)


- documentation
  - setup and configuration
  - clean hardware setup _(easy wiring via patchpanel)_
  - creating how-to videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLJyDlo3Z6eP_X2Pw0-Z8Pw">YouTube</a>


- webUI improvements
  - actors in dashboard elements => when was an action taken; when was it reversed
  - using AJAX for dynamic data refreshment and workflow optimizations


- improve user-experience
  - installation using a pre-configured image - plug and play
  - implementing more input _(sensors)_, output _(actors)_ and connection devices for native support _(air speed sensor/window opener actor/analog to digital converter)_ 


- hardware
  - integration of a scale so that the harvest can be logged
  - off-grid installation => dyndns and hardware-guide
  - sensor-controller/sub-agent
    - we should be able to use an ESP32/ESP8266/RaspberryPico as a wireless source for multiple sensors
    - this would allow the coverage of multiple distributed input-areas (_p.e. multiple patches on a property_)
    


### Maybe future features
- core functionalities
  - agent/server installation
    - server should be able to run as vm or on dedicated hardware
    - cloud-hosted server component


- hardware
  - create plans for 3d printable parts
  - plant monitoring via nfc-tags => <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13X_MqCHwgE">idea source</a>
