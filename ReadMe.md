## But what can it do?

### It provides:
* Simplified use of a <b>raspberry pi</b>
* A '<a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/workflow/input.html">input</a> => 
  <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/workflow/output.html#conditions">condition</a> => 
  <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/workflow/output.html#actions">output</a>' 
  <b>framework</b>
* Easy interaction through a <a href="https://demo.growautomation.eu"><b>web interface</b></a>
* Independence
  * The software-system has no need for external resources like cloud-services nor internet access
* A customizable <b>dashboard-system</b>


### It empowers you to:
* <b>Add</b> your <b>custom devices and actions</b>
* <b>Visually monitor</b> your sensor <b>data</b> via dashboards
* Use the web-ui to <b>easily troubleshoot</b> your hardware setup


### It can help you:
* Getting started with your own automation system
* Prevent <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/basic/troubleshoot.html">common mistakes</a> with your <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/device/input.html">hardware</a> and <a href="https://docs.growautomation.eu/en/latest/setup/wiring.html">wiring</a>
* Optimizing your growing environment
* Having a great time growing
