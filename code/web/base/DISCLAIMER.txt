### DISCLAIMER ###

I do not have much experience with:
* the django framework,
* the mvc software design,
* UI-design and
* web-development itself.

Therefore, this webinterface is NOT:
* object-oriented
* not optimized to use as little code as possible
* secure => I used the basic security config and some common sense; nothing special
* using best-practise html/css/js
* not as much interactivity through js since it is not my strong side
* pretty => just some basic bootstrap UI to serve its functionality; nothing fancy
