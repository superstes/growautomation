Dependencies
------------

* **apt**

  * libgpiod2

* **pip**

  * adafruit-circuitpython-dht

* **privileges**

  * executing user must be a member of group **gpio** (*usermod -a -G gpio USERNAME*)

Config
------

Device model
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Script: `dht22.py <https://github.com/superstes/growautomation/blob/dev/code/device/input/dht22.py>`_
* Script argument: temperature or humidity
* Data unit: °C
* Data type: FLOAT
* Timer: Measurement interval in seconds

Device
^^^^^^

* Connection: GPIO_PIN


Implementation
--------------

This is a digital sensor.

You can connect it to a raspberry gpio port and configure the input-device accordingly.

GA supports this sensor natively.

Wiring
^^^^^^

Pin counting from left to right (*as seen on the picture*)

**Power**

* PIN1 => 3.3V power supply
* PIN4 => ground

**Connections to raspberry**

* PIN2 => any free default gpio


Issues
------

No known issues.

Dependencies
------------

* analogue to digital converter

Config
------

Device model
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Data unit: % RH
* Data type: FLOAT
* Timer: Measurement interval in seconds

Device
^^^^^^

* Connection: ADC_PIN
* Downlink device: Analogue to digital converter (*must be configured as connection device previously*)

Implementation
--------------

This ia an analogue sensor.

You need to connect it via a :ref:`connection-device <device-connection>` .

Wiring
^^^^^^

**Power**

* VCC => 5V power supply
* GND => ground

**Connections to converter**

* AOUT => any free analogue in port

Issues
------

The sensor `pcb <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board>`_ will absorb water => you would want to seal its edges with epoxy resin.

Also the electronic components soldered to the sensor should be protected from moisture by using epoxy resin or a heat-shrink tubing.

You can find a good pictured tutorial of how to do this `here <https://thecavepearlproject.org/2020/10/27/hacking-a-capacitive-soil-moisture-sensor-for-frequency-output/>`_.

* **3.3V**
* **1 ADC PORT**

Device model
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Data unit: % illumination
* Data type: FLOAT
* Timer: Measurement interval in seconds

Device
^^^^^^

* Connection: ADC_PIN
* Downlink device: Analogue to digital converter (*must be configured as connection device previously*)

Implementation
--------------

This sensor has only a rudimentary digit output. For better readings the analogue output should be used.

Therefore you need to connect it via a :ref:`connection-device <device-connection>` .

Wiring
^^^^^^

**Power**

* VCC => 3.3V power supply
* GND => ground

**Connections to converter**

* A0 => any free analogue in port

Issues
------

No known issues.

Issues
------

**NOT RECOMMENDED**

**It will break down after some time because of oxidation**. Releasing unsafe substances.

**You could**:

Turn on the energy supply to the sensor only at the moment you want to read its measurement (*per example with a relay*). This would slow the electrolysis down.
