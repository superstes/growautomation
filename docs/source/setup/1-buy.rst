Description
***********

As it is hard to find a good and inexpensive solution that might fit many users - we will not yet go into what to buy.

We are currently testing some options and will update this guide after collecting more know-how.

The access to your/a network (*LAN/WLAN/..*) and power will not be included in this guide. You can check out the :ref:`connect guide <setup-connect>` for that.
